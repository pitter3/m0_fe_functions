# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    I am most proud of the amount of effort and time I put in today. While my assingments weren't in at the official due date, I really took the time needed to understand the concepts and worked extremely dilligently. I collaborated a ton with Nicole and Kasandra today as well, I am feeling really happy about my understanding of the fundamentals of this language.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
    Functions are extremely powerful because you can make them do just about anything you want them to do (if you have to knowledge to code them). The last example with the fruit sorting made me realize that combining multiple concepts together can unlock a ton of power in just a few lines of code. 

    It is 11:22 PM now for me. I am just doing my reflections now and pushing these to GitHub after a very long day of coding, collaborating, learning, and struggling, but almost all of my struggle today was productive.
